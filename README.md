Fall 2020 Causal Modeling Project for Computational Medicine

This project implements and tests a simple Agent Based Model (ABM) to study the spread of a virus through a population.

## Project Structure
The code for the Agent Based Model is defined as a testable package `abm` under /packages. The package is used in the notebook for simulations.
